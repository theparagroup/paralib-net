move grid into html
expand out style class and recursivily hyphenate over class and property




Design Goals & Notes

1] Build web pages in C# without Razor/Mvc/ASP
2] Create re-usable html/javascript snippet library in C#
	<Action> syntax
	better templating
		reflection to do substitutions, attribute to override '{_FooBar_}' => 'whatever'
	reusable js functions, c# settings => json => function
	better formatting for attribute names, underscores, etc
	by the time attributes get to Element, it should be a simple dictionary - this whole thing needs to be refactored
	make debug a config option

	should be able to nest elementcontainers
		merge element and elementcontainer (elements can have children)
	remove "render" concept


3] Fluent syntax options

x] T4/Razor support library?
