move grid into html
expand out style class and recursivily hyphenate over class and property




Design Goals & Notes

1] Build web pages in C# without Razor/Mvc/ASP
2] Create re-usable html/javascript snippet library in C#

	OnPostEnd in BlockRenderer isn't quite right

	let's build some components and templating/snippet
		more use of <Action> syntax
		reflection to do substitutions, attribute to override '{_FooBar_}' => 'whatever'
		reusable js functions, c# settings => json => function

	page, body, layout
	script management
	built in onready

	better formatting for attribute names, underscores, etc
	data-
	other html5 things
	style

	lets support some other grid systems
	refactor SetClasses

	make debug a config option


	create various IHtml interfaces that shows what's allowed under what?





3] Fluent syntax options

x] T4/Razor support library?
